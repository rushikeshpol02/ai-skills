name: github-issue-classifier
description: Reviews GitHub issues stored as local markdown files (from Github-Issue-Extractor), classifies every non-DONE issue into epics/user stories/tasks/defects by label, and produces two reports — a flat classification with status, and a full hierarchy organized by milestone → epic → story/task → defect. Use when asked to categorize issues, identify epics, build a hierarchy view, find related tickets, or analyze a GitHub issue repo dump.

# GitHub Issue Classifier

Analyzes markdown issues produced by the Github-Issue-Extractor tool. Supports two modes:

- **Mode A — Classify All:** Flat list of every open issue categorized by type, with status
- **Mode B — Hierarchy View:** Full repo organized as Milestone → Epic → Story/Task → Defect

---

## Setup

Issues live in:
```
Github-Issue-Extractor/issues/<owner>-<repo>/
```

Each issue is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter. A `.metadata.json` in the same folder holds state/hash for all issues.

**Always activate the project venv before running scripts:**
```bash
cd Github-Issue-Extractor
source venv/bin/activate
```

Scripts expect PyYAML (already installed via `requirements.txt`).

---

## Mode A — Classify All Issues

Run the classification script:
```bash
python scripts/classify_issues.py issues/<owner>-<repo>/
```

### What it outputs
| Output | Content |
|---|---|
| **File** (full) | `issues/<owner>-<repo>/reports/classification-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — GitHub-flavoured markdown tables for all four types, each row including `# | Status | Labels | Milestone | Title` |
| **Terminal** (summary) | Counts only (Epic / Defect / User Story / Task / Total) + path to the file |

The file is created automatically; no flags needed. Running again on the same day overwrites the file.

### Columns in every issue table
| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| `#` | Issue number |
| `Status` | 🟢 open or ⚫ closed |
| `Labels` | Comma-separated GitHub labels |
| `Milestone` | Milestone name, blank if none |
| `Title` | Linked to the GitHub issue URL |

### Label → Type Mapping

| Label(s) on issue | Assigned Type |
|---|---|
| `epic` | **Epic** |
| `story`, `Technical story` | **User Story** |
| `enhancement` | **User Story** (feature additions have user value) |
| `bug`, `UAT-Bug` | **Defect** |
| `design`, `housekeeping`, `wontfix` | **Task** |
| *(no labels)* | **Task** by default; infer from title if possible |

**Priority when multiple labels exist:** Epic > Defect > User Story > Task

### "DONE" Definition
`state: closed` = Done. Only open issues are shown in the four type buckets.
There is no explicit "DONE" label in this repo's convention — closures are the signal.

### Inferring type from title (unlabeled issues only)
- Title contains `EPIC` → Epic
- Title starts with `SEC:` or `SUSA-` → Task (security audit finding)
- Title contains `BUG`, `CRASH`, `FIX`, `ERROR` → Defect
- Otherwise → Task

---

## Mode B — Hierarchy View

Run the hierarchy script:
```bash
python scripts/build_hierarchy.py issues/<owner>-<repo>/
```

### What it outputs
| Output | Content |
|---|---|
| **File** (full) | `issues/<owner>-<repo>/reports/hierarchy-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — milestone summary table then one section per milestone, closing with a no-milestone section |
| **Terminal** (summary) | Per-milestone counts (Total / Epics / Stories/Tasks / Defects) + path to the file |

The file is created automatically; no flags needed. Running again on the same day overwrites the file.

### File Structure

```
# Issue Hierarchy — <repo>

## Milestones          ← summary table of all milestones

---
## Milestone: Bugs     ← alphabetical order
  ### Epics (N)
    #### 🔗 Epic #XXX — 🟢 open
      | # | Status | Labels | Title |     ← child stories/tasks
      | ↳ #YYY | ...  |        |       ← defects linked to that story
  ### User Stories & Tasks — no epic (N)
      | # | Status | Labels | Title |
      | ↳ #ZZZ | ...  |        |       ← defects linked to story
  ### Defects — no story/task or epic (N)

---
## Milestone: Comms
  ...

---
## No Milestone        ← always last; same internal structure
```

### Milestone ordering
- Named milestones: **alphabetical A → Z**
- Issues with no milestone: collected under **"No Milestone"** at the very end

### How children are linked to an epic
| Priority | Signal |
|---|---|
| 0 — Definitive | `parent_issue` on issue = epic number, or epic's `sub_issues` list contains the issue |
| 1 — Hard data | Same milestone AND keyword match from epic title |

🔗 badge = confirmed via hierarchy link (Signal 0). No badge = milestone/keyword only.

### How defects are linked to a story/task
| Priority | Signal |
|---|---|
| 0 — Definitive | `parent_issue` on defect = story number |
| 1 — Hard data | Standalone `#<story_number>` reference in defect body |

Defects not linked to any story/task or epic appear in the **"Defects — no story/task or epic"** subsection of their milestone.

## Key Rules

1. **Hierarchy first** — `parent_issue` / `sub_issues` frontmatter fields are the strongest signal; always check them before falling back to milestone/keyword
2. **Status always shown** — every issue row in every report includes a `Status` column (🟢 open / ⚫ closed)
3. **No guesswork for confirmed relations** — only report a relationship if at least one signal is present
4. **Always verify false positives** for numeric `#N` references before reporting them
5. **Closed issues included in hierarchy** — the hierarchy view shows all issues (open and closed) so the full picture is visible; status column makes state clear
6. **Superseded stories** — flag duplicates; do not silently omit them
7. **Empty hierarchy** — if `sub_issues` is empty on an epic, that does not mean it has no children; some teams don't use GitHub's sub-issue feature — rely on milestone + keyword signals instead
